## About Me
My name is Joy Kitson and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science
at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/]) as
a part of the [Parallel Software and Systems Group](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu/).
I am also honored to have been selected as a Department of Energy
[Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/)
in 2021.

I study how to best harness high perfromance computing (HPC) resources
to support scientific simulations. In particular, my current work focuses
on leveraging HPC systems to improve our understanding of how infectious
diseases spread by studing ways to balance the flexibility and granularity of
agent-based modeling techniques with their computational costs. I have also
studied the efficacy of a range of parallel frameworks in providing
*performance portability*, efficient execution on a range of HPC systems,
for scientific applcations. For more details, feel free to check out my
[CV](/assets/img/cv.pdf) or
[Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6b_rN9kAAAAJ).

Prior to my time at UMD, I studied at the
[University of Delaware](https://www.cis.udel.edu/), completing my B.S. in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in May 2020. While at UD, I got my
start in research with the
[Global Computing Lab](https://globalcomputing.group/about.html)
-- now at the University of Tennesse -- and the
[Vertically Integrated Projects](https://vip.udel.edu/) program.

In my free time, I enjoy swing dancing (especially Lindy Hop!), reading
science fiction and fantasy novels, and playing tabletop games with friends.
